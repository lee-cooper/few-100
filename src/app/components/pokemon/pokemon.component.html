    Parent-to-child component property binding
    - Property binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. 
    - Use property binding to do things such as toggle button functionality, set paths programmatically, and share values between components.

    Consider the below code:

    selectedPokemon]="pokemonDetail$ | async"

    - the 'pokemonDetails$' observable property on the parent component is bound to the 
      'selectedPokemon' property on the child component. The value it held on the parent is 
      passed down to the child.
    - Additionally, the pipe '|' and the 'async' subscribes to the latest value from the 'pokemonDetails$'
      observable on the parent component and return the latest value emitted. When the component is destroyed,
      the observable is automatically unsubscribed, preventing memory leaks.

  <!-- 
    Child-to-parent event binding
    - Event binding allows you to listen to and respond to events. 
    - Custom event bindings can be created to allow the child component to communicate with the parent
    
    Consider the below code:

    (emitSelectedPokemon)="requestPokemonDetail($event)"

    - Given the parent is listening for an event of 'emitSelectedPokemon' 
    - When the child component emits an event of 'emitSelectedPokemon'
    - Then the 'requestPokemonDetail' function on the parent component will be called
      - The contents of the event are stored in the '$event' argument, and are passed to the parent function
      - NOTE: There will not always be an '$event' argument

    - See Event binding -> https://angular.io/guide/event-binding#custom-events-with-eventemitter

                    (emitSelectedPokemon)="requestPokemonDetail($event)"></app-pokemon-list>
